# Receiving Multiple Streams
While there are multiple ways of viewing multiple streams, we will go over the simplest and most reliable methods in this documentation.

### QGroundControl
We are have developed a modified version of QGroundControl that can allow up to 3 cameras to be streamed at once. This is perfect if you are using ArduSub Companion.

To learn more, see our {doc}`modified version of qgroundcontrol <../software/qgroundcontrol>`

### OBS (Open Broadcasting Software)

OBS is a popular streaming and recording software. If you would like to use this to interface over ethernet with our cameras, please follow our {doc}`Instructions for streaming with OBS <../software/open_broadcasting_software>`
