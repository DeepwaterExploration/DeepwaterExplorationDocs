# ArduSub Companion Setup with exploreHD/HDCam

```{note} **As of November 20, 2021, all exploreHD/HDCam shipped will feature a new firmware that allows the cameras to be plug and play with ArduSub Companion without the need for drivers.**

If you notice the video stream is very sluggish, your exploreHD/HDCam may be on an outdated firmware. Click [here](https://docs.exploredeepwater.com/software/firmware.html) to update the firmware.
```
If you have multiple exploreHDs and you would like to stream them simultaneously, you can use the new [ArduSub Companion 1.0 BETA](https://docs.bluerobotics.com/ardusub-zola/software/companion/1.0/).
