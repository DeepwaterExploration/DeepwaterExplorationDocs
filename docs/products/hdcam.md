## Introduction
The HD USB Camera is the bare board of the exploreHD Camera but without the waterproof housing. This camera provides the same excellent image quality as the exploreHD but uses a specialized lens designed to be more suited for above water applications. The camera can output H.264, MPEG, and YUY2 at reduced frame-rates. Due to its low distortion and smooth frame-rate, this camera is ideal for computer vision applications.
