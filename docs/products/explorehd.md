## Introduction
Our passion for uncompromised image quality for marine robotics is the simple philosophy behind the exploreHD Underwater USB Camera. This UVC compliant camera is the first of its kind to feature a high definition USB output while achieving a waterproof rating of IP69K. With the use of a modern Sony sensor, this camera will be able to see in low light conditions like never before. Thanks to advanced automated exposure and white balance adjustments, this camera produces accurate colors and a pleasing natural image. With H.264 compression technology, up to 4 cameras can be connected at once and streamed via ethernet without major quality loss or latency. This makes our camera the perfect choice for advanced multi-cam ROV/AUV setup.

## Operating Notes
### Lens Field of View in Air vs Water
This lens has a fish eye effect which is more noticeable in air then in water due to the changes with light as it passes through different optical mediums. We took into account this factor and picked a lens that has a very wide field of view in air so that when the lens is in water, it can compensate for the lowered field of view. You may also notice a bit of vignetting when above water from the lens cap that will disappear in the water.
### TrueColor Technology
The camera offers TrueColor Technology which compensates for the blue/greenish tint in water using advance AI white balance technology that we developed. However, in order to reduce the bluish/greenish tint, the camera has to compensate by adding more red/magenta. This means that in some images, the shadows may appear more red or magenta color. If you do not like this effect, you can turn off auto white balance in the exploreHD camera preferences.
