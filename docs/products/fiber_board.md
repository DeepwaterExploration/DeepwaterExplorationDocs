## Introduction

This bare PCB converts CAT 5 Ethernet signals from the RJ-45 port to signals compatible with single mode SFP transceivers and vice versa. By using this media converter, copper Ethernet signals can be extended up to 20km depending on the SFP transceiver used (a much larger distance than the 100 meters limit for copper Ethernet signals).

Unlike many other fiber converters, this is designed to be as space efficient as possible specifically for ROV use cases. Additionally, many considerations were in place to design this board as power efficient as possible, reducing generated heat and maximizing the flight time on your ROV!

**Blue**
* LED4: Power LED, Lights up when +5V is applied

**Red**
* FDX LED: Lights up when Full Duplex is used
* FBR LEF: Lights up when Fiber Port is working (Fiber and Tranciever must be plugged in as a pair)

**Yellow**
* TP: Network is connected via Ethernet
* 100M: 100Mbps Speed is Used
* 1000M: Gigabit Speed is Used
