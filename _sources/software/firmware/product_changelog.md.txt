## [exploreHD (400m)](https://dwe.ai/explorehd)
- Jan. 2024
  - Small fix for high exposure levels at lower framerates
- May 2023
  - Fixed issue where when H.264 is used in lower resolution, artifacts would show up on video.
- Mar. 2022
  - Thanks to DWE OS (previously known as driverUI), the firmware loader no longer needs 2 separate firmware to switch between H.264 and MJPEG streaming.
  - H.264 firmware bitrate has been decreased from 15 Mbps to 10 Mbps for improved stability
- Jan. 2022
  - The firmware loader now has two options of firmware, MJPEG or H.264:
  - MJPEG will provide the highest quality but bandwidth can go as high as 60Mb/s per camera. 
  - H.264 will limit to 10Mb/s and use intelligent compression to maximize quality for the given bandwidth.
- Nov. 2021
  - The loader now disables the other firmware button while loading to minimize the chance of failure
